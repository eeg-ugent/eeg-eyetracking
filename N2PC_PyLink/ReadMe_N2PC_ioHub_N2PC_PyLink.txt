For questions about N2PC_PyLink and N2PC_ioHub, please email to vincent.hoofs@ugent.be

These codes have not been used for research purposes, neither have they been checked by an expert, so please be careful when using this code.

Pilotting of this code has been done in the ActiCHamp lab (basement of the Henri Dunantlaan 2). Facility information: https://www.ugent.be/pp/experimentele-psychologie/en/research/facilities

The N2PC_PyLink and the N2PC_ioHub folders contains Psychopy code (.py) for the N2PC task, extended with EEG and eye tracking measures.

In this task, the participants' task is to localize a particular stimulus property (e.g., the color 'yellow'), and to indicate whether this was positioned left or right within an object or on the screen (the latter is manipulated block-wise).

The main difference between the two codes is that the N2PC_PyLink script simply generates eye tracking data, while the N2PC_ioHub script is actively influenced by the input from the eye tracker. More specifically, the script will provide a visual warning signal and time-out in case that a participant is not fixating on the stimuli.
